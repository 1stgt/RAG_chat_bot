They form the wealth of a country. • Types of Natural Resources: (i)Inexhaustible: There are some resources that are present unlimited in nature and will not be exhausted even if used continuously. Example: Sunlight, Air. (ii)Exhaustible: These resources are limited and can soon get exhausted because of their excessive use. Example: Forests, wildlife, minerals, coal, petroleum, etc. •Coal, petroleum and natural gas are fossil fuels. •Fossil fuels were formed from the dead remains of living organisms millions of years ago. •Fossil fuels are exhaustible resources. •Coke, coal tar and coal gas are the products of coal. •Petroleum gas, petrol, diesel, kerosene, paraffin wax, lubricating oil are obtained by refining petroleum. •Coal and petroleum resources are limited. We should use them judiciously. •Refining: Petroleum is mixture of various constituents such as petroleum gas, petrol, diesel, lubricating oil, paraffin wax, etc. Refining is the process of refracting the various constituents / fractions of petroleum. It carried out in a petroleum refinery. •Natural Gas: A very important fuel as it easy to transport through pipes and can be compressed and stored under high pressure as Compressed Natural Gas. It causes no pollution and has high calorific value. \n","Contents of 08_science_key_notes_ch_06_combustion_and_flame.pdf:\n","Material Downloaded From http://www.ncrtsolutions.inwww.ncrtsolutions.inKey Notes Portal for CBSE Notes, Test Papers, Sample Papers, Tips and Tricks Chapter – 6 Combustion and Flame  • Combustion: The process of burning a substance in the presence of air (oxygen) and undergoes a chemical reaction to produce heat and light. • The substances which burn in air are called combustible. • Oxygen (in air) is essential for combustion. • During the process of combustion, heat and light are given out. • Ignition temperature is the lowest temperature at which a combustible substance catches fire. • Flame: It is a zone or burning vapour. The substances which vapourise during burning give flames. Example: Kerosene oil and molten wax. • Inflammable substances have very low ignition temperature. • Fire can be controlled by removing one or more requirements essential for producing fire. • Water is commonly used to control fires. • Water cannot be used to control fires involving electrical equipments or oils. • There are various types of combustions such as rapid combustion, spontaneous combustion, explosion, etc. • There are three different zones of a flame - dark zone, luminous zone and non-luminous zone. • An ideal fuel is cheap, readily available, readily combustible and easy to transport. It has high calorific value. It does not produce gases or residues that pollute the environment. • Fuels differ in their efficiency and cost. • Fuel efficiency is expressed in terms of its calorific value which is expressed in units of kilojoule per kg. • Types of Fuels: (i)Solid Fuels: Combustile substances which are solid at room temperature. Example: coal, coke, wood, charcoal, etc. (ii)Liquid fuels: Volatile liquids which produce combustible vapour. Example: Petrol, kerosene, alcohol, diesel, etc. Material Downloaded From http://www.ncrtsolutions.inwww.ncrtsolutions.inKey Notes Portal for CBSE Notes, Test Papers, Sample Papers, Tips and Tricks (iii) Gasous fuels: Combustible gases or mixture of combustile gases. Example: Natural gas, LPG, biogas, coal gas, etc. • Effects of Burning of Fuels: (i) Carbon fuels like wood, coal petroleum release unburnt carbon particles. These are dangerous pollutants causing respiratory diseases, such as asthma. (ii)Incomplete combustion of carbon fuels gives carbon monoxide which is a poisonous gas. (iii)Increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the air is believed to cause global warming. (iv)Oxides of Sulphur and nitrogen dissolve in rain water and form acids. Such rain is called acid rain. It is very harmful for crops, buildings and soil. • Unburnt carbon particles in air are dangerous pollutants causing respiratory problems. • Incomplete combustion of a fuel gives poisonous carbon monoxide gas. • Increased percentage of carbon dioxide in air has been linked to global warming. • Oxides of sulphur and nitrogen produced by the burning of coal, diesel and petrol cause acid rain which is harmful for crops, buildings and soil. \n","Contents of Harsh_Resume_DS (4).pdf:\n","Harsh Kumar Yadav +91-7643812551# 1st19cs047@gmail.comï linkedinSummaryMotivated intermediate in Data Science, enthusiastic about AI and ML.

He was not like the other children of the jungle, for he had been found as an infant, abandoned at the edge of a small village on the jungle's fringe. The villagers, kind-hearted and compassionate, took him in and raised him as their own.\r\rMugli grew up amidst the lush greenery, learning the ways of the jungle from the wise elders of the village. He could imitate the calls of the birds, scale trees with ease, and move through the dense foliage without making a sound. But despite his deep connection to the jungle, Mugli always felt a longing for something more, a yearning to explore beyond the familiar borders of his home.\r\rOne day, as Mugli sat by the edge of the village, gazing out into the unknown depths of the jungle, he heard a whisper carried on the breeze. It was a voice unlike any he had ever heard, soft and melodic, beckoning him to embark on a journey into the unknown. Without hesitation, Mugli knew that he must follow this mysterious call.\r\rWith the blessings of the village elders and a few provisions strapped to his back, Mugli set out into the depths of the jungle, guided only by the faint echo of the enchanting voice. For days, he journeyed deeper and deeper into the wilderness, encountering strange creatures and overcoming perilous obstacles along the way.\r\rAs Mugli ventured further from the safety of his village, he encountered tribes of monkeys swinging through the treetops, herds of majestic elephants bathing in sun-dappled streams, and colorful birds with plumage so vibrant it seemed to glow in the dim light of the jungle. Each new discovery filled Mugli with wonder and excitement, fueling his determination to continue his quest.\r\rBut as the days turned into weeks, Mugli began to encounter challenges unlike any he had faced before. He found himself lost in the labyrinthine tangle of the jungle, with no clear path to guide him forward. The once-familiar sounds of the jungle now seemed to taunt him, echoing with a sense of foreboding that sent shivers down his spine.\r\rJust when it seemed that Mugli's journey had reached an insurmountable impasse, he stumbled upon a hidden clearing deep within the heart of the jungle. In the center of the clearing stood a towering tree unlike any Mugli had ever seen before, its branches reaching up towards the heavens like outstretched arms.\r\rAs Mugli approached the tree, he felt a strange energy pulsing through the air, drawing him closer with an irresistible pull. With trembling hands, he reached out and touched the rough bark of the ancient tree, and in that moment, everything changed.\r\rA brilliant flash of light engulfed Mugli, and when it faded, he found himself standing in a place unlike any he had ever seen. Gone were the towering trees and dense undergrowth of the jungle, replaced instead by towering buildings of glass and steel that stretched towards the sky.\r\rConfused and disoriented, Mugli stumbled through the bustling streets of the city, marveling at the sights and sounds that surrounded him. Everywhere he looked, he saw people of all shapes and sizes, moving with purpose and determination through the maze-like streets.\r\rAs Mugli wandered through the city, he encountered kindness and generosity unlike anything he had ever known. Strangers stopped to offer him directions, children laughed and played in the parks, and everywhere he went, he was greeted with smiles and warmth.\r\rBut despite the wonders of the city, Mugli could not shake the feeling of longing that gnawed at his heart. For all its marvels, the city lacked the wild beauty and untamed spirit of the jungle, and try as he might, Mugli could not forget the home he had left behind.\r\rWith a heavy heart, Mugli made the decision to return to the jungle, to the village that had been his home for so long. And though his journey had taken him far from the familiar comforts of his youth, Mugli knew that he would always carry the spirit of the jungle with him, wherever his adventures might lead.\n","Contents of qna_PDF.docx:\n","Chapter – 17 Stars and the Solar System • The phases of the moon occur because we can see only that part of the moon which reflects the light of the Sun towards us. • Stars are celestial bodies that emit light of their own. Our sun is also a star. • It is convenient to express distances of stars in light years. • Stars appear to move from east to west. • The pole star appears to be stationary from the Earth, because it is situated close to the direction of the axis of rotation of the Earth. • Constellations are groups of stars that appear to form recognisable shapes. • The solar system consists of eight planets and host of asteroids, comets and meteors. • A body revolving around another body is called a satellite. • Moon is the natural satellite of the Earth. Some planets also have natural satellites. • Venus is the brightest planet in the night sky. • Jupiter is the largest planet of the solar system. • The artificial satellites revolve around the Earth. They are much closer than the moon. • Artificial satellites are used for weather forecasting, long distance communication and remote sensing. • Sun: It is the source of almost all energy on Earth. It continuously emits huge amounts of heat and light. • Planets: A planet has a definite path in which it revolves around the sun called orbit. Time taken by a planet to complete one revolution increases as the distance from the sun increases. • There are eight planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupitar, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. • Other members in our solar system are: (i) Asteroids: These are rocky planetary bits orbiting around sun. asteroid belt lies between Mars and Jupiter. (ii) Comets: These are heavenly bodies that revolve around the sun. It appears generally as a bright head with a long tail.

Smalle meteors melt and burn up creating streaks of light. Few meteoroids which survive as they pass through the Earth’s atmosphere and reach the Earth surface are called meteorites. (iv) Artificial Satellites: Man-made objects sent into space to orbit the earth.
